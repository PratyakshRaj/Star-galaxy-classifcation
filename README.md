# Star-galaxy-classification
here we predict poiint objects as stars or galaxies using fluxes of different bands.
1. matching data from different catalogs and its wrangling.
2. using AB magnitudes of different bands in (1XN)matrix form for CNN
3. comparing AUC and over fitting of CNN with other supervised algos.
4. visualisation of metrices and feature dependence of star galaxy classification.
